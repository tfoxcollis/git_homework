Take aways:
  1. Reading ahead before class helps me understand the material
  2. I'm not as organized as I thought I was.  Also, calendaring is difficult and will take time to perfect.
Stratagies:
  1. Commiting to my calendar schedule
  2. Using git diff to see changes before I commit.
Shoutout:
  To my husband James, who has been keeping me sane and encouraging me to pursue coding.
